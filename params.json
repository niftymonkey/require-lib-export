{"body":"## Synopsis\r\n\r\nThis is an attempt to work through the options for exporting a javascript library that uses [RequireJS][1].\r\n\r\n## Intent\r\n\r\nThe goal of this experiment is to show how to do the following with your [RequireJS][1]-enabled library:\r\n* Export your javascript library module.\r\n* Ensure that none of your module dependencies leak out into global space.\r\n* Show how to reduce or remove the knowledge of [RequireJS][1] for users of your library.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nIn the process of trying to build a modular and reusable component library, I understandably came to the conclusion that I would want to \r\nuse an [AMD][2] script loader.  I chose [RequireJS][1] to handle that.  However, I quickly realized that if I wanted to ensure that the\r\nlibrary was going to meet my expectations, I'd have to have a better understanding of how the loader did its thing.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I have created this example project as a reference for how to accomplish this. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: http://requirejs.org/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD","tagline":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
